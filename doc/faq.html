      <H1>                Cyrus IMAP Server FAQ</H1>

<ul>
<li><b>Using PAM</b> Under Linux when using PAM and shadow passwords,
/etc/shadow needs to be readable by the Cyrus user. 

<li><b>Using NFS</b> We don't recommend it. If you want to do it, it
may possibly work but you may also lose your email or have corrupted
<tt>cyrus.*</tt> files. You can look at the mailing list archives for
more information.

<li><b>Virtual hosting</b> - We don't support it and don't plan to support it
unless we get a set of complete patches.  If you want it, you'll need
to do it yourself or use a commercial product. Check the list archives
for more information.

<li><b>dots in userids</b> - no you can't have a '.' in your username.

<li><b>renaming users</b> - nope, not supported.

<li><b>plus addressing</b>

<li><b>Performance/Capacity/Scaling</b> - There is no good answer for
this. It depends on your hardware, your operating system, and how your
users use the system.  In general, an <tt>imapd</tt> process takes up
anywhere from 256 Kbytes of memory to 512 Kbytes when it is first
fired up. CPU has not been a big deal, but it may become more
important as the imap sessions are encrypted and now that searching
may be more frequent. Disk I/O is probably the most important and
having a hardware RAID subsystem with an amount of write-back cache
would be a good thing.

<p>Finally, if you are talking about less than 100 interactive users
it is likely that any relatively modern hardware can support it. If
you are talking about having more than 1000 interactive users, you
should know how to predict your utilization, go overboard on hardware,
be willing to suffer growing pains, or be able to hire someone that
can help. 

<p>There are a number of good performance tuning articles out for
Solaris by Adrian Cockcroft. Go to your favorite search engine and
look for his name.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>Q:</b> I'm getting syslog'd messages from the master process
saying processes are "signaled to death by 10".  What's up?</dt>
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> If you're using Berkeley DB 3.0.55, try installing some
<a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/update/3.0.55/patch.3.0.55.html">patches
to Berkeley DB</a> available from <a
href="http://www.sleepycat.com/update/3.0.55/patch.3.0.55.html">
http://www.sleepycat.com/update/3.0.55/patch.3.0.55.html</a>.</dd>

<dt><b>Q:</b> I've used <tt>saslpasswd</tt> to create CRAM-MD5
secrets, but imapd doesn't say <tt>AUTH=CRAM-MD5</tt>. Why?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> Make sure <tt>/etc/sasldb</tt> is readable by the Cyrus user.

<dt><b>Q:</b> I'm getting messages like:
<pre>
Jan 14 13:46:24 grant ctl_deliver[9060]: duplicate_prune: opening
/var/imap/deliverdb/deliver-x.db: No such file or directory
Jan 14 13:46:24 grant ctl_deliver[9060]: duplicate_prune: opening
  /var/imap/deliverdb/deliver-y.db: No such file or directory
Jan 14 13:46:24 grant ctl_deliver[9060]: duplicate_prune: opening
  /var/imap/deliverdb/deliver-z.db: No such file or directory
</pre>
in my <tt>imapd.log</tt> file.  What's wrong?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> These messages are normal; one file is maintained for
each user beginning with "x", "y", "z", etc.  If you're first starting
or you have no users beginning with these letters, these messages are
completely normal and can be ignored.

<dt><b>Q:</b> I'm getting messages like:
<pre>
Jul  3 16:51:36 acadia imapd: could not getenv(CYRUS_SERVICE); exiting
</pre>
in my <tt>imapd.log</tt> file.  What's wrong?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> Remove all <tt>imap</tt>, <tt>pop</tt>, <tt>lmtp</tt> and
<tt>sieve</tt> lines from <tt>[x]inetd.conf</tt> and restart
<tt>[x]inetd</tt>.

<dt><b>Q:</b> How do I use different SSL/TLS certificates for
imap and pop (or disable SSL/TLS for pop)?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> Use a separate config file for one of the services.  For
example, change the pop3 service in <tt>cyrus.conf</tt> to something like:
<pre>
pop3    cmd="pop3d -C /etc/pop3d.conf" listen="pop3"
</pre>
then copy <tt>/etc/imapd.conf</tt> to <tt>/etc/pop3d.conf</tt> and
change the <tt>tls_*</tt> options to use your POP3 specific
certificate (or remove them to disable SSL/TLS).

<dt><b>Q:</b> My KPOP client is complaining about TLS keys.  What
should I do?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> Disable TLS for the kpop service. See the answer to the
previous question for details.
