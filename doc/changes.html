hopefully improving performance

<li> changed how Berkeley db databases are opened, hopefully lessening
the chance of deadlock and improving performance

<li> fixed a couple of memory leaks

<li> lessened the chance of a race condition during <tt>index_check()</tt>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.12</h2>
<ul>
<li> refactored code so less duplication

<li> added alternate config file for partial virtual domain support

<li> <tt>pop3d</tt> can now disable USER/PASS commands.

layer.

<li> <tt>master</tt> now supports maximum number of service processes
via the "maxchild" modifier.

<ul>
<li> portability fixes involving <tt>setrlimit()</tt></li>

<li> fixed compiler warnings</li>

<li> the STARTTLS command will only accept TLSv1 now, not SSLv2/v3.
The <tt>imaps</tt> port is unaffected by this change.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.8</h2>
<ul>
<li> remembered to update this file

<li> bug in <tt>Cyrus::IMAP</tt> perl module affecting cyradm's
setquota fixed

<li> portability fix with <tt>socklen_t</tt>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.7</h2>
<ul>
<li> preliminary implementation of the IDLE extension (Ken Murchison,
<tt>ken@oceana.com</tt>).

<li> THREAD=REFERENCES now part of the normal build.

<li> tweaks to the installation documentation and suggested Sendmail

via UCD SNMP AgentX

<li> many fixes to Cyrus Murder-related code

<li> fixes to perl code, especially the Sieve interface. added an IMSP
interface to the perl code, but it still needs work.

</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.6</h2>
<ul>
<li> some number of random static variables eliminated, to save on
memory footprint

<li> recursive RENAME was a little to eager; fixed.  RENAME will also
give the client a hint that a sub-RENAME failed.  (mostly probably
useful for cyradm, but cyradm doesn't take advantage of it yet.)

<li> THREAD=X-JWZ has turned into THREAD=REFERENCES (Ken Murchison)

<li> DELETE wasn't failing cleanly in database code; fixed.

<li> off-by-one bug in seen_db fixed.

<li> starting/committing/aborting transactions now logged more
correctly in cyrsudb_db3

<li> master will now accept port numbers instead of just service names
in cyrus.conf.  also logs even more verbosely (see bug #115.)

<li> libwrap_init() is now inside the loop, since i don't quite
understand the semantics of libwrap calls.

<li> setquota in cyradm now behaves more sanely (and gives correct
usage message).

<li> bugfixes to the managesieve client perl api. (still needs work.)

<li> small fixes in timsieved.

<li> added a "make dist" target so i won't dread releases as much.
</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.5</h2>
<ul>
<li> APPEND now honors the \Seen flag.

<li> mailboxes file can once again be a flat text file. (compile-time choice)

<li> subscriptions file can be flat text or berkeley db.  likewise for
seen state.

<li> unfortunately, the format of the mailboxes file has changed.

<li> implementation of "JWZ" threading, a first pass on the
forthcoming THREAD=REFERENCES.

<li> bugfixes in libacap.

<li> bugfixes in other Murder related functionality.

<li> removal of dead code.

<li> will now look in CYRUS_PREFIX/etc/imapd.conf if there's no
/etc/imapd.conf.

<li> more paranoid implementation of ID.

<li> more descriptive lmtp errors.

<li> finished implementation of LMTP 8BITMIME.

<li> fixed minor bugs in pop3d.

<li> small test suite for cyrusdb backends added in
<tt>lib/test/</tt>.

<li> added <tt>-DPERL_POLLUTE</tt> to the perl compilation to deal
with Perl 5.6.

<li> small additions to the Sieve library.

<li> As usual, owe lots of thanks to Ken Murchison for his hard work
and awesome implementations.

</ul>


<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server SINCE 2.0.4</h2>
<ul>
<li> Now should work with Berkeley DB 3.1, but does <b>not</b>
auto-upgrade 3.0 databases (and, in fact, I haven't written any
upgrade software yet).

<li> SORT and THREAD should now function correctly.

<li> Some configure fixes.

<li> Some fixes for possible race conditions in initializing services
and database structures.

<li> Some non-gcc compile fixes with structure initialization.

<li> Some non gcc compile fixes with structure initialization.
</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server SINCE 2.0.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>fixed <tt>mbpath</tt> and <tt>ipurge</tt>. Thanks to Alain Turbide
for the bug report.

<li> configure: removed <tt>mmap_private.c</tt>; it was buggy, and not worth
supporting.

<li> configure: improvements in detecting libwrap, typos fixed in
detecting libsasl.

<li> Merged the acapsieve library into libacap.

<li> improvements to the ACAP API.

<li> invariant checks added to the skiplist code.

<li> bugfix in TCL cyradm.

<li> acapmbox.c: bugfixes in handling acap connections.

<li> fix the size given for a unix socket address (changes throughout
the code), patch thanks to Vladimir Kravchenko, <tt>jimson@null.ru</tt>.

<li> rewrote <tt>deliver</tt> to use the generic LMTP API in
lmtpengine.c.  Likewise, implemented the client-side API in
lmtpengine.c. (Still need to implement AUTH.)

<li> added SORT and THREAD support (Ken Murchison,
<tt>ken@oceana.com</tt>.)

<li> In checking an APPEND command, we were rejecting valid system
flags and accepting invalid ones.

<li> minor bug fixes to <tt>proxyd</tt>.

<li> large amount of debugging code added to <tt>target-acap</tt>.

<li> build fixes to Perl programs.

<li> allow plaintext authentication to <tt>timsieved</tt>.

</ul>

<h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server in 2.0 </h2>
<ul>
<li> The mailboxes file is now a transaction-protected Berkeley
database.

<li> The core delivery process has been moved to <tt>lmtpd</tt>.
<tt>deliver</tt> is now a simple wrapper to create an LMTP transaction.

<li> master process, responsible for spawning services (<tt>imapd</tt>,
<tt>lmtpd</tt>, etc.) and for routine housekeeping.  Optionally, it
can use <tt>libwrap</tt> to allow or deny connections.

<li> ACAP (Application Configuration Access Protocol) support for
Cyrus Murder: IMAP Aggregator.

<li> Sieve enhancements: regular expressions, notifications,
automatically setting IMAP flags.

<li> SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) support for monitoring
usage (e.g. number of users logged in) as well as for instrumenting
protocol usage (e.g. number of times CREATE has been called).

<li> Perl version of <tt>cyradm</tt> contributed by Brandon Allbery
(<tt>allbery@ece.cmu.edu</tt>).  Eventually we expect to transition to
the Perl version away from the TCL version.

<li>Bugfix in modified UTF-7 processing (for mailbox names).
Bugfix in <tt>index_searchcacheheader()</tt>.

<li>Implemented the extension MULTIAPPEND.

<li>RENAME is now hierarchical.

<li>The right that controls whether a mailbox may be deleted is now
"c".  (It used to be "d".)

<li>An additional backend for seen state has been created,
<tt>seen_db</tt>.  It stores seen state in a per-user database.
</ul>

    <h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.20 </h2>
    <ul>
    <li> Some fixes to the TLS support to gracefully degrade service.

    <li> Sieve now correctly re-sieves messages that are received with
    identical message-ids, but different envelopes.  It also obeys
    plus-addressing on keep actions.  (Fixes by Ken
    Murchison, <tt>ken@oceana.com</tt>.)

    <li> The server wasn't correctly calculating the percentage of
    quota used when deciding whether or not to issue a warning.

    <li> Implemented single-instance store: deliver, when using LMTP,
    will only store one copy of a message per partition, and hard link
    it among multiple users.  Sites with a large number of partitions
    could see a performance decrease.

    </ul>

    <h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.19 </h2>
    <ul>
    <li> Added STARTTLS support; requires OpenSSL.

    <li> Sieve now uses MDNs to reject messages instead of DSNs,
    conforming to the latest Sieve specification. (Ken Murchison)

    <li> The duplicate delivery database expiration (deliver -E) was
    deleting all entries; fixed.

    <li> imtest is now a little smarter about parsing the protocol to
    avoid synchronization errors prior to authentication.

    <li> timsieved's parser is now written in C; should be no
    noticeable changes, but should make compiling it much easier.
    </ul>

    <h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.16 </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Fix to enclosed message parsing (thanks to John Myers).

      <li> When trying to skip over non-synchronizing literals during
      error recovery, the IMAP server never stopped eating.  Fixed.

      <li> Added <tt>with-sasldir</tt> as a configure option.

      <li> Fixed a bug in cyradm when it got the CAPABILITY list.

      <li> Fixed bugs relating to the incomplete SASLfication of
      deliver.

      <li> Fixed bugs in deliver relating to duplicate delivery
      suppression and Sieve vacation functionality.

      <li> Fixed a memory leak in deliver.

      <li> When looking for SASL options, imapd wasn't defaulting to
      the option without the plugin name requesting it.  This caused
      PLAIN authentications to incorrectly fail.

      <li> Changed the expiration time of pts entries to 3 hours; only
      affects sites using krb_pts as the authorization method.

      <li> Fixed some bugs in imclient; mostly affects cyradm.

      <li> Fixed a bug in the Sieve lexer and improved the usefulness
      of the Sieve test program.
    </ul>

    <h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.13 </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> An annoying memory management bug in imclient was fixed and
      it's efficiency was improved somewhat.

      <li> Added the sieve client (<tt>installsieve</tt>) and server
      (<tt>timsieved</tt>) for getting sieve scripts onto the server
      and managing them once they are there.

      <li> The default Sieve script layout has changed to
      sievedir/u/user/default; this supports multiple Sieve scripts
      per user with the ability to switch between them.
 
      <li> Fixed the kerberos-to-local-host bug (patch by Greg Hudson,
      <tt>ghudson@mit.edu</tt>).

      <li> Started changes to deliver to support LMTP AUTH.

      <li> Improved the error messages logged when authentication
      fails.
      
      <li> Fixed a bug dealing with argument processing in the
      arbitron program.

      <li> pop3d now correctly supports SASL AUTH.

      <li> imtest will no longer prompt for authentication or
      authorization names; instead, it defaults to the current Unix
      user.  Override on the command line.

      <li> Likewise, cyradm will no longer prompt.  It now accepts
      "-m" to specify what SASL mechanism to use, and the
      pwcommand option to authenticate should once again work when
      used non-interactively.
    </ul>

    <h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.10 </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Changed the sieve option in the configure script to
      <tt>--disable-sieve</tt>.

      <li> Updated reconstruct and quota to check for hashed imap
      spool directories correctly.

      <li> deliver now will not use Sieve if duplicate delivery
      suppression is disabled.  There was also a bug that caused the
      duplicate delivery database to be checked even if dupelim was
      disabled.

      <li> deliver now uses tm_gmtoff if available to check for the
      local timezone.

      <li> The default format for reading information from INN has
      changed.  If you use INN to feed imapd news, you must change
      your "<tt>newsfeeds</tt>" file to contain
      <pre>collectnews!:*:Tf,WO:collectnews</pre>

      <li> The dohash script now takes a "<tt>-i</tt>" option to run
      interactively and the "<tt>-f</tt>" option to issue warnings
      instead of fatal errors.
    </ul>

    <h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.1-BETA </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> cyradm should now work with all mechanisms (it now handles
      empty challenges and responses).

      <li> Fixed deliver to deal with arbitrarily long headers

      <li> COPY for non-existent sequence numbers returns NO; this
      contrasts to UID COPY, which always returns OK.

      <li> FETCH for non-existent sequence numbers returns NO; this
      contrasts to UID FETCH, which always returns OK.

      <li> Fixed a misleading BAD responses to commands that take
      sequences.

      <li> Added UIDNEXT untagged response to a SELECT (from
      <tt>draft-crispin-imapv-07.txt</tt>).

      <li> pop3d now correctly passes SASL configuration options to libsasl.

      <li> imtest now correctly flushes the server's output to the
      screen.

      <li> Added more hashing using a simple but stupid algorithm.
      Now whenever there is a mailbox access, quota access, or
      subscription access, it goes through a hash function. this is
      done to help reduce the number of files/directories in any given
      directory.

      <li>Added the binary <tt>mbpath</tt>. Given a mailbox name, this
      binary will print the filesystem path to that mailbox. This way
      if you have multiple partitions and hashing turned out, you
      don't have to spend as many mental cycles figuring out where the
      actual directory is.

      <li> deliver now checks <tt>sieveusehomedir</tt> and
      <tt>sievedir</tt> in the config file to determine where to look
      for sieve scripts.

      <li> ptloader now has a workaround for afs 3.5.

      <li> clarified an error message in message.c when an unexpected
      end of file is encountered.

      <li> fixed some random memory leaks in deliver.

      <li> fixed a fairly major bug in prot_fill.  it was performing
      incorrectly when reading only a single character.

      <li> fixed a bug in how imtest looked for OK or NO.

      <li> fixed a memory leak in imapd.

      <li> imapd now allows any user (or member of a group) listed in
      "proxyservers" to proxy.
    </ul>

    <h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.0-BETA </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> fixed stupid bug in imapd

      <li> fixed sasl/config.c interaction

      <li> fixed use of stat in imtest

    </ul>

    <h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.24 </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> ANSI C is now required.

      <li> imtest's interface has changed, to allow for SASL
        authentication.  Sorry, but it had to happen.  It now also
	includes a timing test (-z) which we use to test the SASL layers.

      <li> imtest no longer uses a non-synchronizing literal with
	LOGIN, so it should work against all IMAP servers.

      <li> The prot layer now uses SASL for encryption and
        authentication.  This changed a large amount of code, and some
	build procedures.

      <li> As a side effect of SASL, --enable-static-libraries now 
        doesn't do anything.  We are considering compiling cyrus with
	libtool to change this.

      <li> Error codes returned by programs have changed, and programs return
	EX_TEMPFAIL far more than they used to.  This is because Sendmail
	considers most not-EX_TEMPFAIL errors permanent; now, if it may not be 
	permanent, EX_TEMPFAIL is returned.  (See lib/exitcodes.h.)

      <li> Two bugs fixed: UID FETCH's with no messages in range now
	return OK, not BAD.  And an obscure bug in LIST case
	sensitivity is fixed.

    </ul>

    <h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.19 </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> Most of the charset.c code (and mkchartable.c code) has been
	replaced thanks to John Myers).

      <li> Bug fix in message.c to look up headers in the cache when they're
	in the cache correctly; thanks to Chris Newman for the fix.

      <li> Code cleanup here and there (thanks to Bruce Balden).

      <li> Annoying (and confusing) lines in syslog every time a message was
	delivered if deliver was compiled using dbm saying that deliver was
	"unable to fetch entry" have been removed.

      <li> Content-Disposition lines were being parsed improperly.  If they
	had no optional arguments, they were being ignored as if they were
	syntactically incorrect.  This is fixed, but imapd will continue to
	serve wrong information unless cyrus.caches are rebuilt (with
	reconstruct) for any message that was added to the mailbox before this 
	bug was fixed.

      <li> The arbitron program now takes a mailbox pattern argument for the
	mailbox to run on. The manpage always said it did anyway. 

      <li> Uninitialized variable fixed in imapd.c with the shutdown file
	code.

      <li> Minor tweaks to purify build config.

      <li> Fix minor memory leak in proc.c where procfname wasn't
	being free'd.

      <li> Fix brain fart in auth_krb_pts.c where a CLOSE() was done
      to a DB handle BEFORE we access the data read from the DB
      database. This means we were copying free'd memory into the
      groups list.  Note this only affects people using DB, AFS and
      ptloader.

      <li>Committed minor syslog log level changes in ptloader and
	deliver. 

      <li>make distclean now does what it's supposed to.

      <li>Possibly misnamed experimental --enable-static-libraries switch that
	tries to do a good job of building binaries with whatever static
	libraries are availible.  If you use this, you do so at your own risk,
	and if it fails, we will disavow all knowledge of you and your team.
	Good luck, Jim.

      <li>Add optional third argument to imtest for it to take input
	from a file. This is a gross hack.

    </ul>

    <h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.14</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	LIST now honors the reference argument.

	<p>
	  This behavior can be turned off by a configuration option
	  imapd.conf--which may be desirable because of certain clients that
	  ask for a "mail directory" setting for IMAP which will now cause
	  problems when it was ignored before.  (The default is for the
	  reference argument to be honored.)

      <li>
	The <tt>arbitron</tt> program now takes a mailbox pattern argument for
	the mailbox to run on.  The manpage always said it did anyway.

      <li>
	Added --disable-server switch to optionally prevent compilation of
	server to help sites that just want client libraries (so cyradm and
	libcyrus can be compiled on remote systems without installing stuff
	into /usr/cyrus/bin, etc.)  For now, the server is still configured in
	this case, and a Makefile is generated.  This could change in future
	versions.

      <li> Fixed a mmap leak in index.c in index_search_evaluate
	that caused problems on complex searches.  Thanks to Jeff Schiller
	for pointing this out.  Fixed a potential leak in mboxlist.c that
	happened if a rename went awry.  Thanks to Chris Newman for pointing
	this out.

      <li> Fixed a bug in LIST and LSUB code so that user.* mailboxes will be
	printed on every LIST instead of just the first one.

      <li> Implemented the <i>POP3 Extension Mechanism</i>, RFC 2449,
	in order to advertise the capabilities already supported.

      <li> Fixed a bug in mailbox.c that disallowed MUTF-7 representations of
        ASCII characters when it shouldn't have.  (Thanks to John Myers for
	providing a fix and to Per Steinar Iversen for telling me that I
	didn't do it before.)

      <li> More cleanup the ptloader/auth_krb_pts code. If you use Kerberos
	and IMSP, you *MUST* pick up cyrus-imspd-v1.5a6 (or newer).

      <li> A few configure tweaks.

      <li> Duplicate delivery changes:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Split out duplicate delivery elimination to multiple
	    files. This should help reduce the lock contention that normally
	    occurs with this file. To not clutter <i>config_dir</i>, the files
	    will be located in a subdirectory named <tt>deliverdb</tt>, for
	    example <tt>/var/imap/deliverdb</tt>. If you don't make this
	    directory, nothing bad will happen (other than duplicate delivery
	    elimination will not work).
	    
	  <li> The time value is now stored as an integer in native byte order
	    as opposed to converting it to a string before it is stored in the
	    database.
	    
	  <li> checkdelivered() now obtains a read lock instead of a write
	    lock when trying to check for duplicates. Only markdelivered()
	    grabs a write lock.
	</ul>

      <li> Added logic to cause cyradm to abort more cleanly if not given
        command line arguments in an interactive session.  This gets
        rid of the dreaded <tt>application-specific intialization failed</tt>
        messages.
    </ul>

    

<h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.11</h2>

<ul>

<li> The CREATE command now ignores a trailing hierarchy delimiter instead of
ignoring the CREATE command.

<li> UIDPLUS is now always advertised in CAPABILITY and is always availible.
The UIDPLUS extension is a set of optimizations using UID values instead of
sequence numbers and is described in RFC 2359.

<li> Cyrus no longer rejects messages with 8-bit characters in the headers.
Rather than reject the message, characters with the 8th bit set are changed to 
'X'.  Internationalization in headers is supported by the mechanism specified
in RFC 2047 (and RFC 1342).
</ul>

<h2> Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.10</h2>

<ul>

<li> If ENABLE_EXPERIMENT is set, the server no longer claims to support
OPTIMIZE-1; instead, it claims to support UIDPLUS.  The Getuids command has
been removed since it is not in the UIDPLUS document
(draft-myers-imap-optimize-03.txt).

<li> The checks for Tcl in configure are much smarter.  The configure script
asks tclsh where its configuration lives, then consults the shell scripts that 
have that information.  This should work with 7.5 or better, which is what the 
server requires anyway.  (All the previous checks to look for Tcl
	libraries are gone; now, configure runs tclsh and asks it where
	the Tcl libraries are, then runs the shell scripts that are in
	that directory.  Since the tclConfig.sh script may not be in that
	directory, it looks in .. as well.)

<li> The checks for com_err in configure are a little smarter and look
	to see if all the pieces are there before trying to use them.

<li> Added support for the NAMESPACE extension (if --enable-experiment is
	supplied).

<li> Added a "reject8bit" switch to imapd.conf.  If set to "true", messages
	containing 8-bit-set characters in the headers are rejected (the
	previous behavior); if set to "false" or left to the default value,
	messages containing 8-bit-set characters have these characters changed 
	to a constant character ('X').

<li> Added the "fud" program.   This is an interm hack designed to allow
	allow finger information to be retrieved for cyrus users.  This
	is experimental and it is not recommend that services be built
	arround this feature, since it is likely to be removed in a
	future release of the IMAP server.

<li> Bug fix: User defined flags now work properly.

</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.2</h2>

<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug with word alignment on Solaris using Kerberos compiled
	  with Sun's CC.  (Several patches were submitted; thanks to
	  everyone who did so.)

<li> Patches from John Myers, including more glob fixes.

<li> Use the default hash function from DB. Note that this means that
	  the existing <tt>delivered.db</tt> and <tt>ptscache.db</tt>
	  is <b>NOT</b> compatible with this release.  These files should be
	  removed.

<li> Provide two debugging programs that dump the databases:
	  <tt>ptdump</tt> and <tt>dump_deliverdb</tt>.

<li> Multiple changes to ptloader. added a bunch of flags; let it
	  reauthenticate on its own; added support perl wrapper; added
	  bunch of debugging information/output; bunch of other cleanups

<li> The mailboxes file is now closed if it isn't likely to be referenced,
	  hopefully preventing old mailboxes files from hanging around in
	  memory as frequently.

<li> Added a patch from Eric Hagberg to work around a possible deadlock
	  condition in mboxlist.c where rename isn't atomic.

<li> Patch from John Myers to get rid of cyrus.seen corruption in
	  bsearch_mem.

<li> Patch from John Myers and to allow ISO-8859-1 characters in
	  mailbox names.

<li> Makedepend still runs, and still generates warnings, but these are
	  squirrled away in makedepend.log.

<li> On mailbox delete, the server will no longer try and unlink ".." and
	  "." as we got a report that it seriously breaks one file system
	  (even as non-root).

<li> Added some support for Netscape's very misleading "Administrate My
	  Mail" menu option in Communicator.  Allows for a URL to be set in
	  imapd.conf for the page to refer users to; needs to be turned on
	  with --enable-netscapehack at compile time to enable it.

<li> Bug swap: imtest quotes password with a non-synchronizing literal in
order to allow weird characters like ) in passwords.  But it doesn't
look to see if the server supports non-synchronizing literals.

<li> If the file "<TT>msg/motd</TT>" exists, the first line is now sent to
clients upon login.

<li> Bug fix: to handle BODY[] properly when fetching news articles
(truncation no longer occurs). (thanks to John Prevost)

<li> The makedepend supplied should now run on Solaris Intel.  (thanks to
Chris Newman)

<li> Added some hacks to pwcheck.c for Linux and Digital Unix where the
default protections on the socket don't allow the cyrus user to read it.
(thanks to Lyndon Nerenberg)

<li> Bug fix: Flags beginning with \ are system flags and users can
only create the defined flags.  The code to do this before was
confused.

<li> The configure scripts and makefiles have some random fixes.

<li> Added a contrib directory for reasons of laziness in collecting
	  patches, not all of which should be in the distribution.

<li> ptloader can now renew its AFS authentication by reading from a srvtab
	  file.

<li> The configure script now looks for a libcom_err and can use an
	  installed one if one exists.

<li> Other small bug fixes.

</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5</h2>

<ul>

<li>Bug fix: RENAME corrupted mailboxes if they had been EXPUNGEd.  (may
have only happened with INBOX, which Pine tickles once a month.)

<li>Bug fix: auth_newstate now initializes its structures.

<li>Bug fix: pop3d.c, a printf was changed to prot_printf.

<li>Cyrus now sends X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME to alert clients that it is
not handling RENAME in an IMAP4rev1 compliant manner.  This will be fixed
in a subsequent release.

<li>Bug fix: imclient_autenticate now does resolution on the hostname
before authenticating to it.  This caused problems when
authenticating to an address that was a CNAME.

<li>Bug fix: LIST %.% (and other multiple hierarchy delimiter matches)
works properly.  Several other glob.c fixes are included as well.

<li>Bug fix: a fetch of exclusively BODY[HEADER.FIELDS...] should now
work properly.

<li> Bug fix: reconstruct now considers a nonexistant INN news directory
        to be empty; this makes reconstruct fix the cyrus.* files in the
        imap news partition.

<li> Added a manpage for imclient.

<li> Fixed a few other minor bugs.

</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.4</h2>

<ul>

<LI> Implemented the "<TT>IMAP4rev1</TT>" protocol commands.  
(The hierarchical behavior of RENAME, which was added late to the
IMAP4rev1 specification, is not implemented.)
Changes
the minor version number of the cyrus mailbox database format to 1.
<B>IMPORTANT:</B> it is necessary to run the command "<TT>reconstruct
-r</TT>" as the cyrus user after upgrading the Cyrus IMAP software
from version 1.4 or earlier.

<LI> If the file "<TT>msg/shutdown</TT>" exits in
the configuration directory, the IMAP server will issue the first line
in the file in an untagged BYE message and shut down.

<LI> Permit SPACE in mailbox names.

<LI> Permit the "modified UTF-7" internationalized mailbox name convention.

<LI> "User opened mailbox" messages are now logged at the DEBUG level
instead of the INFO level.

<LI> Added <tt>-q</tt> (ignore quota) switch to <tt>deliver</tt>.

<LI> New "<TT>krbck</TT>" program for diagnosing common kerberos problems.

<LI> auth_unix no longer requires users to be in the passwd file.

<LI> AUTHENTICATE command now reports the protection mechanism in use
in the text of the tagged OK response

<LI> Make MAILBOX_BADFORMAT and MAILBOX_NOTSUPPORTED temporary errors.

<LI> Use the header cache for SEARCH HEADER

<LI> Use "unspecified-domain" instead of server's hostname to fill out
RFC 822 addresses without the "@domain" part.

<LI> Make "reconstruct -r" with no args reconstruct every mailbox.

<LI> The configure script now defaults to using unix_pwcheck instead
of unix if the file /etc/shadow exists.

<LI> The location of the pwcheck socket directory now defaults to
"<TT>/var/ptclient/</TT>".  It is controlled by the
"<TT>--with-statedir=DIR</TT>" option, which defaults to
"<TT>/var</TT>".

<LI> Bug fix: by using an certain address form, one could deliver to a
user's mailbox bypassing the ACL's.

<LI> Bug fix: un-fold header lines when parsing for the ENVELOPE.

<LI> Delete quota roots when deleting the last mailbox that uses them.
Doesn't catch all cases, but should get over 99% of them.

<LI> Implement plaintextloginpause configuration option, imposes
artificial delay on plaintext password logins.

<LI> Implement popminpoll configuration option, limits frequency of
POP3 logins.

<LI> Implement AFS PT server group support.

<LI> Remove persistence of POP3 LAST value and remove Status: hack

<LI> Support the new ACL command set in the IMAP server.

<LI> Bug fix: Have to initialize reply to 0 in pop3d.  Was causing
POP3 server to occasionally drop the connection during authentication.

<LI> Bug fix: The COPY command wasn't issuing a [TRYCREATE] when
appropriate for sub-mailboxes of INBOX.

<li> Bug fix: Renaming a mailbox wasn't correctly changing its
UIDVALIDITY.

<li> Bug fix: Renaming a mailbox to itself, in order to move it to a
different partition, was not working correctly.

<li> Update the AUTH support in pop3d to conform to the latest draft
specification.

<LI> Update cyradm to use Tcl 7.5 instead of Tcl 7.4

<LI> Re-implement large sections of the netnews support.  It no longer
requires modifications to INN, as it now expunges the index entries
for expired/canceled articles upon select of the newsgroup.

<LI> Implement newsspool configuration option, for separating the
directories for the news spool and the various cyrus.* IMAP server
index files.

<LI> Bug fix: permit empty flag list in APPEND command

<LI> Bug fix: deal with truncated Date: header values.

<LI> Bug fix: memory mapping code, deal better with 0-length maps, since
mmap() appears to crap out on that boundary condition.

<LI> Portability fix: if no strerror, have to define NEED_SYS_ERRLIST.

<LI> Bug fix: used append instead of lappend in cyradmin, preventing
use of any port other than IMAP.

<LI> When the client is streaming its commands, the IMAP server attempts
to stream its tagged responses.

<LI> Modify zephyr support to compile without Kerberos support.

<LI> Add a bunch of prototype declararations to the code.

<LI> In deliver, change the MULT support to instead use the LMTP syntax.

<li> imclient: support tagged intermediate replies and a default
callback.

<LI> Implement some experimental protocol extensions for optimizing
disconnected use resynchronization.  Most extensions are disabled by
default.  Client authors should contact info-cyrus@andrew.cmu.edu if
they wish to experiment with these.

<LI> In Makefiles, change $(AR) to ar -- HPUX make is defective.

<LI> In deliver, use HAVE_LIBDB to select use of db over dbm

<LI> Add map_stupidshared mapping module for older versions of Digital
Unix.  It's not quite as bad as HPUX, but...

<LI> Bug fix: in imclient.c, don't free NULL pointers and don't call
htons() on the output of getservbyname().  Have to abort sending
the command if you get a tagged response when sending a literal.

<LI> The auth_xxx routines now create/take a state argument instead of
maintaining internal static state.

<LI> Solaris mktime() is buggy in some releases.  Create and use
mkgmtime() for parsing date strings.

<LI> Message parsing routines now use memory mapping, though they
still copy data around in line-sized buffers.

</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.3</h2>

<ul>

<LI> Implemented the "<TT>reconstruct -m</TT>" command, for
reconstructing the <TT>mailboxes</TT> file.  <B>IMPORTANT:</B> it is
necessary to run the command "<TT>reconstruct -m</TT>" as the cyrus
user after upgrading the Cyrus IMAP software from version 1.3 or
earlier.  We recommend you make a backup copy of the
<TT>mailboxes</TT> file in the configuration directory before
performing the conversion.

<LI>Mailbox names are now case
sensitive, not case insensitive.  "<TT>INBOX</TT>" is the exception, and is treated as being case-insensitive.

<LI> Personal mailboxes now appear to their owners as being under the
"<TT>INBOX.</TT>" hierarchy.  For example, the mailbox
"<TT>user.bovik.work</TT>" appears to the user "<TT>bovik</TT>" as
"<TT>INBOX.work</TT>".  The user may still refer to the mailbox with the name
"<TT>user.bovik.work</TT>".

<LI> Previously, the code used "<TT>anybody</TT>" as the name of the
group that all users are in, but the documentation used the name
"<TT>anyone</TT>".  Changed the code to match the documentation.
The name "<TT>anybody</TT>" will be canonicalized to the name
"<TT>anyone</TT>".

<LI> The install document now gives different recommended locations
for the server databases.  The recommended location of the
configuration directory changed from "<TT>/usr/cyrus</TT>" to
"<TT>/var/imap</TT>" and the recommended location of the default
partition directory changed from "<TT>/usr/spool/cyrus</TT>" to
"<TT>/var/spool/imap</TT>".  It is <B>NOT</B> necessary to change the
locations of these directories when upgrading from version 1.3 or
earlier of the Cyrus IMAP server software.  If you do wish to change
the locations of these directories to match the new recommendations,
simply rename the directories and change the appropriate values in
your <TT>/etc/imapd.conf</TT> file.

<LI>Created a "<TT>make install</TT>" rule.  See the <a
href="install.html">installation</a> document for all the new
corresponding <TT>configure</TT> options.  Note the recommended
location of the "<TT>imapd</TT>", "<TT>pop3d</TT>", and
"<TT>deliver</TT>" programs has changed, this change needs to be
reflected in the "<TT>inetd.conf</TT>" and "<TT>sendmail.cf</TT>"
files.

<LI>New "<TT>login_unix_pwcheck</TT>" module and "<TT>pwcheck</TT>"
daemon, for improved shadow password support.   See the
"<TT>pwcheck/README.pwcheck</TT>" file in the distribution for details.

<LI>Renamed the "<TT>login_unix_shadow</TT>" module to
"<TT>login_unix_getspnam</TT>".

<LI>Added a mail notification mechanism, using Zephyr.

<LI>Added a feature to automatically create user IMAP accounts.
Controlled by the "<TT>autocreatequota</TT>" config option.

<LI>Added the "<TT>logtimestamps</TT>" config option, for putting
timestamp information into protocol telemetry logs.

<LI>Beefed up the Kerberos checks in Configure to ensure the DES library
routines exist.

<LI>On some systems, the "<TT>echo</TT>" command with no arguments
emits a newline.  Changed the installation document to instead use the
"<TT>true</TT>" command to create the "<TT>mailboxes</TT>" file.

<LI>Store a redundant copy of a mailbox's ACL in the <TT>cyrus.header</TT>
file, so "<TT>reconstruct -m</TT>" may later use it as a backup.

<LI>Had to remove the declaration of <TT>tcl_RcFileName</TT> for
the latest version of Tcl.

<LI>Make much more extensive use of memory mapping.  Replace the
binary search module with one that searches a memory mapped area.

<LI>Replaced the yacc-based RFC822 address parser with a hand-coded one.

<LI>Replaced the et (error table) libary with a version that doesn't
require lex or yacc.  Remove the lex/yacc checking from Configure.

<LI>Safety feature: most programs now refuse to run as root.

<LI>Bug fix: Issue [TRYCREATE] tag on COPY command when appropriate.

<LI>Bug fix: The quoted-printable decoder wasn't ignoring trailing
whitespace, as required by MIME.

<LI>Bug fix: Don't spew cascade errors if the server gets an EOF
during/after reading an APPEND literal.

<LI>Bug fix: gmtmoff_gmtime.c was returning results with the wrong sign.

<LI>Bug fix: imclient_send was appending spaces to %d and %u and the
response parser was not handling responses that did not contain a
space after the keyword.

<LI>Bug fix: rmnews wasn't removing some (un-indexed) article files
correctly.

<LI>Completely disabled the dropoff code for now.  It will be
completely replaced when IMSP integration is implemented

<LI>Added workaround for the Linux mkdir() problem.

<LI>In Configure, use a more direct test for a working shared-memory mmap

<LI>In collectnews, avoid O(n**2) behavior when processing articles
that have already expired.

<LI>Bug fix: append_addseen() would screw up if no messages were
previously seen.

<LI>Added the CMU-specific amssync and cmulocal directories.

<LI>Use memmove instead of bcopy.

<LI>Implemented the first pass of SMTP/MULT support in deliver.

<LI>Added cacheid parameter to auth_setid(), for AFS PT server support.

</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.2</h2>

<ul>

<li>Fixed bug in character set code that broke text searches.  Sites
which care about searching headers need to reconstruct their existing
mailboxes.

care about internationalized searching of headers need to reconstruct
all their existing mailboxes.

<li>Fix some errors in the iso-8859-* tables.

<li>Add and correct a bunch of case-independence mappings in the
character tables.

<li>First pass at implementing the <TT>STATUS</TT> extension; disabled for

<li>Better error reporting on reads that end up short.
</ul>

<h2>Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.0-Beta</h2>
<p>
<ul> 
<li>Improved <a href="install.html">installation</a> document.
<li>New "<a href="cyradm.1.html"><tt>cyradm</tt></a>" administrative client.
<li>Changed the syslog facility from "<a href="install.html#syslog"><tt>local4</tt></a>" to "<tt>local6</tt>".
<li>Removed the <tt>renounce setuid</tt> check in "<a href="install.html#deliver"><tt>deliver</tt>"</a>.  The "<tt>deliver</tt>" program
  must now be <b>non</b>-executable by <tt>other</tt>.
<li>Fixed a typo in the parsing of <tt>SEARCH DELETED</tt>.
  (This bug constantly got tripped by newer C-clients.)
<li>Redesigned the implementation of <tt>SEARCH CHARSET</tt>.<br>
  Sites that wish to search for non-ASCII characters
  in the headers of existing mailboxes must run <tt>reconstruct</tt>
  on all their mailboxes after upgrading to this version.
