<h1>Cyrus and Netnews
</h1>
<body>

<b><i>Note that the NNTP support in Cyrus is still relatively young in
the grand scheme of things, and has not been tested under a heavy
Usenet load.  That being said, the code appears to be stable and is
currently running in production serving 50-60 newsgroups with a volume
of about 6000 messages per day.</i></b>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Cyrus has the ability to export Usenet via IMAP and/or export shared
IMAP mailboxes via NNTP.  This is made possible by a new NNTP daemon
which is included with Cyrus.

<p>This document assumes that you have successfully been able to setup
your Cyrus IMAP server.  If you have not already done so, please refer
to the rest of the documentation.  This document also assumes that you
are familiar with Usenet and shared IMAP mailboxes.

<p>There is a <A HREF=netnews.png>diagram</A> that shows the interactions of
the various components of the NNTP support in Cyrus which may be
helpful in understanding the "big picture".<p>
