Some general hints that all made it into my 11/15 16:47 commit that I
think may be generally useful to people hacking on the cyrus source:

- Command line apps should link cli_fatal.o so they all fatal()
in the same way, unless there is a really good reason they need to do
something unique.
- If you call config_init() you must call cyrus_done() before you exit.
- No one should ever call DB->init() or DB->done() cyrusdb functions
except for in libcyrus_init()
- I've been trying to keep #include statements for libcyrus and libimap
alphabetical, and below any system includes, but this is merely my personal
style
- Don't exit at the bottom of main with exit(x) use return instead.
- For all the command line utilities that need to be sure that they are
running as cyrus, it should be the first thing they do, and they should
exit with an appropriate fatal() call
- All services should have a shut_down call.  It should be the ONLY way of
exiting the application.  fatal() should always make an attempt to call
shut_down() if it can (though it should have a recursive fatal() trap just
in case).  Similarly, commandline utilities probably don't need a shut_down().
