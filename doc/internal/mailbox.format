This is an attempt to document the cyrus mailbox format.  It should not
be considered authoritative and is subject to change.

No external tools should make use of this information.  Instead they should
only make use of the standard interfaces to the cyurs mail store (IMAP, POP,
LMTP, etc).

---

A cyrus mailbox is a directory in the filesystem.  Its entries can
be one of the following types:

-> A message file
-> A metadata file (cyrus.header, cyrus.index, cyrus.cache)
-> A sub-mailbox (a directory)

The message files are named by their UID, followed by a '.', so UID 423
would be named '423.'

The metadata files are where things get interesting.

cyrus.header:

This file contains mailbox-wide information that does not change that
often.

Its format:
<Mailbox Header Magic String>
<Quota Root>\t<Mailbox Unique ID String>\n
<Space-separated list of user flags>\n
<Mailbox ACL>\n

cyrus.index and cyrus.cache:

These files cache frequently accessed information on a per-message basis.
The index file holds fixed-length records on a per-message basis (and
a header for the mailbox of related metadata), while the cache
file holds variable-length information.

These files have all binary data stored in network byte order.  Strings
are stored NUL-terminated (this only applies to cyrus.cache).  All of the
binary data is also 4-byte aligned (to accomplish this, the end of strings
may be NUL-padded by up to 4 bytes).

The overall format of these files looks sort of like this:

cyrus.index:
+----------------+
| Mailbox Header |
+----------------+
| Msg: Seq Num 1 |
+----------------+
| Msg: Seq Num 2 |
+----------------+
|     ...        |
+----------------+

The basic idea being that there is one header, and then all the message
records are evenly spaced throughout the file.  All of the entires into
each message record are at well-known offsets, making any part of
the file accessable at roughly equal speed.

cyrus.cache:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Gen # (32bits)|Size 1 (32bits)|Data 1                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|           |Size 2 (32bits)|Data 2            |Size 3 (32bits)| Data 3  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .....                                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The cache file is different from the index file.  It starts with a 4
byte header (the generation number...more on that later), then it has
a whole bunch of entries in (size)(data) format.  The entires for each
message are always consecutive, and in the same order (i.e. for any given
message, the envelope is always the first bit of data), but there is no
way to tell (without use of an offset from the index file) what message
starts where.

Detail of cyrus.index header:

The index header contains the following information, in order:

Generation Number (4 bytes) -
  A number that is basically the "revision number" of the mailbox.  It must
  match between the cache and index files.  This is to ensure that if we
  fail to sync both the cache and index files and a crash happens (so that
  only one is synced), we do not provide bad data to the user.

Format (4 bytes) -
  Basically obsolete (indicates netnews or regular).

Minor Version (4 bytes) -
  Indicates the version number of the index file.  This can be used
  for on-the-fly upgrades of the index and cache files.

Start Offset (4 bytes) -
  Size of index header.

Record Size (4 bytes) -
  Size of an index record.

Exists (4 bytes) -
  How many messages are in the mailbox.

Last Appenddate (4 bytes) -
  (time_t) of the last time a message was appended

Last UID (4 bytes) -
  ???  - (is this UIDNEXT - 1?)

Quota Mailbox Used (4 bytes) -
  ???

POP3 Last Login (4 bytes) -
  (time_t) of the last pop3 login to this INBOX

UIDvalidity (4 bytes) -
  Take a guess.

Deleted, Answered, and Flagged (4 bytes each) -
  Counts of how many messages have each flag.

POP3 New UIDL (4 bytes) -
  Flag signalling that we're using <uidvalidity>.<uid> instead of just
  <uid> for the output of the POP3 UIDL command.

There are also spare fields in the index header, to allow for future
expansion without forcing an upgrade of the file.


Detail of cyrus.index records:

These records start immediately following the cyrus.index
header, and are all fixed size.  They are in-order by sequence number
of the message.

UID (4 bytes) - 
  UID of the message

INTERNALDATE (4 bytes) -
  INTERNALDATE of the message

SENTDATE (4 bytes) -
  Contents of the Date: header.

SIZE (4 bytes) -
  Size of the whole message (in octets)

HEADER SIZE (4 bytes) -
  Size of the message header (in octets)

CONTENT_OFFSET (4 bytes) -
  Offset into the message file where the message content begins.

CACHE_OFFSET (4 bytes) -
  Offset into the cache file for the beginning of this message's
  cache entry.

LAST UPDATED (4 bytes) -
  (time_t) of the last time this record was changed

SYSTEM FLAGS (4 bytes) -
  Bitmask showing which system flags are set/unset

USER FLAGS (MAX_USER_FLAGS / 32 bytes)
  Bitmask showing which user flags are set/unset

CONTENT_LINES (4 bytes) -
  Number of text lines contained in the message content (body).

Cache file format detail:

The order of fields per record in the cache file is as follows:
(keep in mind that they are all preceeded by a 4 byte network byte order
size).

Envelope Response -
  Raw IMAP response for a request for the envelope.

Bodystructure Response -
  Raw IMAP response for a request for the bodystructure.

Body Response -
  Raw IMAP response for an (old style) request for the body.

Binary Bodystructure -
  Offsets into the message file to pull out various body parts.
  (xxx this needs more description of the actual format used.
   message_write_section in message.c)

Cache Header -
  Any cached header fields.  These are in the same format they would
  appear in the message file:

  HeaderName: headerdata\r\n

  Examples include: References, In-Reply-To, etc.

From -
  The from header.

To -
  The to header.

Cc -
  The CC header.

Bcc -
  The BCC header.

Subject -
  The Subject header.

Notes about access:
  - Expunge is very slow (it requires rewriting both the cache and index file)

  - On open we build up an in-memory representation of a UID->seqno index,
    among other things.

  - Append is fast (it only adds to the end of both the cache and index files)

  - Delivery is something like this:

    - Sync message file
    - Sync index file + generation number
    - Sync cache file + generation number

Future considerations:
  - Cache all header fields? (or all up to Xk?)  This could greatly improve
    speeds of clients that just ask for everything, but also increases the
    expense of rewriting the cache file (as well as the size it takes
    on disk).

  - Reformat cache file to use a (size)(size)(size)(size)(data)(data)(data)
    format.  This makes accesses anywhere in the cache file equally fast,
    as opposed to having to iterate through all the entires for a given
    message to get to the last one.  Note that either way is still O(1)
    so maybe it doesn't matter much.

  - Can we do better with expunge if we don't rewrite the cache file as often?
    (instead, allow it to accumulate dead data, and only once in a while
     sweep through and clear out the dead data).  This should be fine
    from a correctness standpoint since if we eliminate the index record we
    just don't have a pointer to the cache file data anymore.

  - It would be useful to store a uniqueid -> mailbox name index, so that
    we could fix arbitron again.
