CMU Sieve 1.2
-------------

Added additional callbacks (ok, so I want to make my integration with deliver
easier) and envelope and vacation support.

Made it compile without libcyrus.
It should compile without libcyrus, but then it does not implement the
"address" test.	 That's just too much work to do when I have a neato
library to do it for me.

Todo:
- regex matching

CMU Sieve 1.1
-------------

- Updated to draft-showalter-sieve-07bis.txt

- Simple API (see sieve_interface.h; currently mostly undocumented)

- Implements all of the optional features except "envelope"

- Maintains "if it parses, it probably runs" behavior. (Goal: minimize
  run-time errors.)

CMU Sieve 1.0
-------------

- prototype implementation
