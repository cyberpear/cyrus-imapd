This is the Carnegie Mellon University Cyrus IMAP Server.

This distribution is what we are running on our production servers.  

The 2.1 and 2.0 releases contains many new features over 1.6.

No further development work will progress on 1.6 so we encourage you
to work with the Cyrus 2.1 code wherever possible.  Support for 1.6 is
extremely limited.  (We only have the resources to support the latest
release.)

Version 1.6 can be found at:
  ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/cyrus-imapd-1.6.24.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/BETA/cyrus-imapd-1.6.25.tar.gz

1.5 at this point is ancient; many interesting bugs have been fixed
since then.  You should expect absolutely no support at all for that
code base.

If you continue to install this software PLEASE be sure to read the
documentation as a number of items have changed.  Please also refer to
doc/bugs.html for any outstanding bugs with the current release.

Note that CMU only provides a source distribution. If you run into
problems with any binary distribution, please contact the source of
the binary distribution.
