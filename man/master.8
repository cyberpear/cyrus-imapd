.SH NAME
master \- master Cyrus process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B master
[
.B \-l
.I listen queue
]
[
.B \-D
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Master
is the process that controls all of the Cyrus processes. This process
is responsible for creating all imapd, pop3d, lmtpd and sieved child
processes. This process also initializes the Berkeley DB code and
performs scheduled cleanup/maintenance.
.PP
If this process dies, then no new sessions will be started.
.PP
It kills itself and all child processes
when it receives a SIGTERM.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-l " listen queue backlog"
Increase the listen queue backlog. By default, the listen queue is set
to 32.   On systems with a high connection rate, it may be desirable
to increase this value. refer to \fBlisten(2)\fR for details.
.TP
.BI \-D
Don't close stdin/stdout/stderr. Primiarly useful for debugging.
.SH CONFIGURATION
Upon execution,
.I master
reads its configuration information out of the
.IR cyrus.conf (5)
file.
.PP
.I Master
rereads its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal,
SIGHUP.  Services and events may be added, deleted or modified when the
configuration file is reread.  Any active services removed from the
configuration file will be allowed to run until completion.
.SH NOTES
The environment variable \fBCYRUS_VERBOSE\fR can be set to log additional
debugging information. Setting the value to 1 results in base level logging. 
Setting it higher results in more log messages being generated.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/cyrus.conf, /etc/imapd.conf
